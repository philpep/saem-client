Creating the windows binary ::

  pip install pyinstaller
  pip install -e .
  pyinstaller --hidden-import six --hidden-import packaging --hidden-import packaging.version --hidden-import packaging.requirements --clean saem-client.py


You should then have a `saem-client.exe` in `dist/saem-client/` directory. You
should ship the whole directory.
